# Hello, World (>_ )!

I'm **Reinhart "reinhart1010" Previano Koentjoro**. Used to be a humble web developer since 2014 (13 y.o.), but sooner I have to leave to fulfill my nation's prophecy, to reborn as the legendary **Anak IT**, a human who's granted otherworldly knowledge and power in every single aspect of IT.

<p><details><summary>My current skills include...</summary> Astro, C, C (Arduino), C#, Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare Workers, CouchDB, CSS, Dart, Flutter, GitHub Actions, Go, HTML, Java, Java (Android), JavaScript, Jekyll, JSX, MariaDB, MySQL, Next.js, PHP, Python, React, Remix, Siri Shortcuts, Swift, Tasker, TSX, TypeScript, and Vala. Not to mention those great libraries like Bootstrap, Flask, and Laravel.</details></p>

Not to mention that I have the power to:

+ âœŠ [Save myself from Thanos with a piece of JavaScript](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-savage-thing-youve-ever-done/answer/Reinhart-Previano)!
+ ðŸ“† Built an [online event registration system](https://registration.himtibnus.org) for [HIMTI BINUS University](https://himti.or.id) that lasts for 3 years (and counting!)
+ ðŸŽ¨ Do great UI/UX design, and even **fanarts of the happy-looking (>_ ) Terminal app**.
+ âœ… Somehow managed to have [1,109 contributions on GitHub in 2021](https://reinhart1010.id/blog/2022/01/05/what-does-it-feel-to-have-1000-github-contributions-in-2021). Oh wait, and [2,258 + 5,276 contributions in 2024](https://reinhart1010.id/blog/2024/04/26/github-my-robots-are-2-5x-as-productive-as-i-am)!
  - ...and getting countless emails from real CEOs asking whether those green tiles are real (>_ )!

My trusty sidekick, **Shiftine**, is always by my side, handling day-to-day operations with precision. With [2.5x the number of GitHub Contributions than I am](https://github.com/1010bots), sheâ€™s a powerhouse in her own right, ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently.
