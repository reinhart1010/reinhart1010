**Hello, World!**

I'm **Reinhart "reinhart1010" Previano Koentjoro**. Used to be a humble web developer since 2014 (13 y.o.), but sooner I have to leave to fulfill my nation's prophecy, to reborn as the legendary **Anak IT**, a human who's granted otherworldly knowledge and power in every single aspect of IT.

<p><details><summary>My current skills include...</summary> Astro, C, Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare Workers, CouchDB, CSS, Dart, Flutter, GitHub Actions, Go, HTML, Java, Java (Android), JavaScript, Jekyll, JSX, MariaDB, MySQL, Next.js, PHP, Python, React, Remix, Siri Shortcuts, Swift, Tasker, TSX, TypeScript, and Vala.</details></p>

As a consequence of being an **Anak IT**, I  get really busy doing things. That's why I'm no longer just writing websites and software, but also making friends and botfriends, and even [augmenting myself as a botfriend who helps others over the cyberspace](https://shift.reinhart1010.id)!

<!-- We'd like to name ourselves as **Anak i++** (meaning: a step beyond just being an Anak IT) and **Hackers and Jackets**, because we believe both words came from the same etymological origins, and 'cause hackers wearing jackets kinda cool, though. ðŸ˜Ž -->

Oh yes, this special GitHub repo is also used to host the source code of me, as an executable software, and our wiki! Please come and check out https://github.com/reinhart1010/reinhart1010 if you haven't already.
