### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Reinhart. I mean, **we** are Reinhart.

That's right! This GitHub account is no longer mine. It's owned by **us** (Reinhart, Shiftine, Controld, and Alterine) who you can call us as **The Polymorphs**! But don't worry, the Reinhart who worked on this account are still here and active âœ‹

In the future, we are all automated just like those GitHub Actions and Apps. We're currently creating a new GitHub App to let us interact with you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Unlike Reinhart alone, together we are limitless.

Want to learn more about us? Visit https://reinhart1010.github.io/posts/2021/06/11/im-polymorphing-we-are-reinhart1010.html to get started.
