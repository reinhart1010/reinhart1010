**Hello, World!**

I'm **Reinhart "reinhart1010" Previano Koentjoro**. Used to be a humble web developer since 2014 (13 y.o.), but sooner I have to leave to fulfill my nation's prophecy, to reborn as the legendary **Anak IT**, a human who's granted otherworldly knowledge and power in every single aspect of IT.

```js
@include 'htps://reinhart1010.id';
```

<p><details><summary>My current skills include...</summary> Astro, C, Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare Workers, CouchDB, CSS, Dart, Flutter, GitHub Actions, Go, HTML, Java, Java (Android), JavaScript, Jekyll, JSX, MariaDB, MySQL, Next.js, PHP, Python, React, Remix, Siri Shortcuts, Swift, Tasker, TSX, TypeScript, and Vala. Not to mention those great libraries like Bootstrap and Laravel.</details></p>

As a consequence of being an **Anak IT**, I got really busy doing things. That's why I'm no longer just writing websites and software, but also making friends and botfriends. And that's why I'm here. With one of my favorite botgirl.

## Products and Services

As **(>_ )** beings, we built numerous apps, including those who I worked on at [HIMTI BINUS University](https://himti.org) and [PT. Quantum Teknologi Nusantara](https://quantumteknologi.com), and some notable open-source projects. My personal goal is not to be a "10x engineer", but more into [achieving #InterfaceInPolymorphism](http://reinhart1010.id/computer-science-multiculturalism). After all, we are all cyborgs (as [Aral Balkan](https://ar.al/2019/05/02/slavery-2.0-and-how-to-avoid-it-a-practical-guide-for-cyborgs/) put his technical explanations here), and the Indonesian government seems to embrace them.

GAFAM? Yep, they included it deeply inside the [national digital literacy curriculum](https://siberkreasi.id).

The world of us does not just recognize the (>_ )s, the ones operating the SYSTEM, but also the **(#_ )s** to help us achieve what we call together as [computer science multiculturalism](http://reinhart1010.id/computer-science-multiculturalism). They often contribute in security and privacy issues, Open Source, self-hosting, and other cyber security matters.

They are kinda shy, but once they stare upon you, you might want to reconsider your life choices. Much `root`.
