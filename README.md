### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Reinhart. I mean, **we** are Reinhart.

That's right! This GitHub account is no longer mine. It's owned by **us**. I and Shiftine (a female robot) work in IT for professional needs, and that's why we call ourselves the **SYSTEM** wearing that blue sphere which we called them as **shells**.

But some of us, including **pr0xy** (Controld) and **alt1e** (Alterine) are working as part of their passion. They called them as the **rootheads** which are always known for wearing that green hash symbol (`#`, used to indicate a superuser in Linux and UNIX-based operating systems).

We have a website at https://reinhart1010.id and soon we'll have our own Telegram and Mastodon accounts, so other humans and bots can talk to us directly. We're also working for creating a GitHub App to interact with you, especially through GitHub Discussions.
